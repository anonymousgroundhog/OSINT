The hacker has submitted to us a suspicious looking Android application.
Investigate the suspicious APK file using jadx-gui tool.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/skylot/jadx.git
cd jadx
./gradlew dist
```

Make sure to go to the `build/jadx/bin` to run the app.

Once you finish the analysis of suspicious details associated with the app submit your findings in your teamâ€™s inject-submissions channel on Discord.
